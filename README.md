# MileStones
- <code>Milestone1</code> is playing around with the AST returned by the HyLine parser and general setup of the command loop. Usage (argument is database directory)(command valgrind checks memory):
<pre>
$ ./sql5300 ~/cpsc5300/data
</pre>
- <code>Milestone2</code> Implement heap storage engine. Implemented the basic functions needed for HeapTable with two data types: integer and text.

# Bugs
- <code>Memory Leak</code>
- <code>Fail After three tests</code>
